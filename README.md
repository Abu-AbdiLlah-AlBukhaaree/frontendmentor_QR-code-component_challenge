- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to make the width of an element responsive by using css `width` and `min-width` properties.
An example is shown below:

```css
<div class="div">Some Content</div>
```

```css
.div {
  width: 80%;
  max-width: 300px;
}
```

The example above ensures that the width of `.div` will always be `80%` of its parent container.
However, when its size reaches `300px`, it stops growing (this means, it stops taking up 80% of its parent and starts taking up 300px instead).

### Continued development

As of now (28 June, 2023), I realize that I still have a long way to go at mastering responsive designs.

I look forward to mastering it soon.
